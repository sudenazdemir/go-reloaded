**Hello! This project is a text editing project.**

> [!NOTE]
Please write your text in input.txt.

> [!TIP]
If you want to make your word or words uppercase, write next to the word you want (up) or next to the last of the words you want (up, 2).
This also applies to Lowercase, and Capitalize such as (cap) (cap, 2) (low) (low, 2)

Example: How to write (up) code?

> [!WARNING]
If you don't use it this way, the program won't do what you want.

> [!TIP]
>If you want to make your number hexadecimal number or binary number, write next to the word you want (hex) or (bin).

> [!TIP]
If there are punctuation marks other than ' or ' ', it will write those punctuation marks at the end of the word on the right and then leave a space.
If there is a ' sign, this deletes the spaces between the word between the quote and the word between it, and if there is more than one word between the quote, it deletes the space between the word close to the quote and the quote.

Example: "I am exactly how they describe me: 'awesome'" -> "I am exactly how they describe me: 'awesome'" 

Example:  "As Elton John said: ' I am the most well-known homosexual in the world '" -> "As Elton John said: 'I am the most well-known homosexual in the world'" 

**Apart from these, the program automatically corrects if there is incorrect A/An usage.**
